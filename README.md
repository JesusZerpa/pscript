PScript
========

PScript is a Python to JavaScript compiler. It was developed as a part of
[Flexx](http://flexx.live) (as `flexx.pyscript`) and is now represented
as its own project. Although it is still an important part of the Flexx
project, it can also be useful by itself.


Installation
------------

PScript requires Python 2.7 or 3.5+ and also works on pypy. 

* ``conda install pscript -c conda-forge``, or
* ``pip install pscript``
